## A brief introduction to Polish as a second language
## A non-pompous intro to...


## Should you study Polish as a second language?

In general, no, you should not learn Polish as a second language. It's too hard, with minimal payoff. With the time and effort you'll spend learning Polish, you can learn:

    * Both Spanish and French (2 for 1 deal, with more than a whole continent's worth of native speakers)
    * All of Russian (a language which works very well in ~10's of countries)
    * More than half of Chinese (with > a billion native speakers in the world)
    * More than half of Japanese (foreign Japanese speakers are rare and consequently valuable)

Each of these options above is vastly more useful than Polish. You should only learn Polish as a second language if you have an extremely strong reason, such as "I have a business opportunity which will allow me to become generationally wealthy, if only I can learn Polish." Reasons like "My husband is Polish" or "I live in Warsaw for my job" are almost certainly not strong enough to merit the enormous time-and-effort commitment required to learn Polish. It's best to think of learning Polish a bit like learning Estonian or Swahili; possible but difficult, with minimal practical benefit.

## Why is Polish hard

Polish is hard for several reasons, described in subsections below.

### Declensions

Like many Slavic languages, Polish has a complicted system of declensions aka grammar, though nobody ever clearly explains what this means to new students. In practice, it means that every word comes in 7 forms aka declensions, and the 7 forms are sometimes sufficiently dissimilar to each other that it might seem like you have to learn each word ~7 different times. Also, there is a complicated system of rules for choosing which declension form to use, and when to use it, depending mostly on context and situation. This means that learning Polish is in some sense like learning 7 languages, plus also learning which situation to use each of the 7 languages in. Here's an example:

*English:* 

```I am with Tom.```



*Using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:* 

```I am with Tomem.```



Notice that the word "Tom," which is a person's name, was changed here, in this case by adding the suffix `-em` to the end of it. This suffix `-em` is one of the 7 transformations, but not all of the 7 declension transformations are so straightforward. If we adjust the sentence, a different declension form is needed. Here's another example:


*English:* 

```I am without Tom.```


*Using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:*  

```I am without Toma.```

Notice that the word "Tom," was changed here, but was changed *differently* than above. Here, we added the suffix `-a`. This suffix `-a` is one of the 7 declension-form transformations, but of course it's not the same as the `-em` transformation above. If you mix them up, or use the one when you ought to use the other, you are mostly intelligible to native speakers, but you sound like an adorably clueless foreigner/illiterate fool.

TODO: COLOR CODE THESE ENDINGS

This declension-form-transformation thing occurs not just with people's names, but instead in almost all situations of practical relevance. Here's the classic textbook declension example to help you get the hang of it. Take these two English sentences:

*English:* 

```The ball is below the table.```


*English again, slightly different sentence:*

```The ball is beside the table.```

It looks like this if we glue the Polish declension-transformations onto English words:

*Using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:* 

```The ball is below the tablem.```

*Slightly different sentence, using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:* 

```The ball is beside the tablu.```

Notice that the word "table" is the same in both of those English sentences above. On the other hand, in Polish, the word "table" changes, depending on where the ball is, as you see in the latter pair of sentences. If this situation strikes you as utterly mad, you're not alone; welcome to Polish. It's such a bizarre idea for English speakers that some students refuse to believe anyone would design a language like this; yet here we are. 

Of course, we've picked super-simple sentences here, which require super-simple declension forms. In practice, you mostly need declension transformations which are 1) harder to pronounce than the simple ones we used above, 2) not just additive suffixes, but involve subtracting sounds or sometimes nearly-unrecognizeable full transformations of words and 3) involve navigating a complicated mental flowchart for deciding which declension-form to use, often approximately of the form "if X then use Y, unless Z, in which case check A and B to decide if it should be C or D." Needless to say there are gallons of exceptions and special cases, such that you end up with plenty of memorization even if you're good at learning the rules.

There is a further wrinkle in that not only Polish nouns must be declined, but also adjectives. Here's an example:

*English:* 

```The ball is below the tall table.```

*English again, slightly different sentence:*

```The ball is beside the tall table.```

Notice that the words `tall` and also `table` are the same in both English sentences. Let's compare to English-with-Polish-declension-endings:

*Using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:* 

```The ball is below the tallem tablem ```

*Slightly different sentence, using Polish declension forms, glued to the end of English:*

```The ball is beside the tallego tablu```

Notice a couple things here. First, when the ball is *below* the table, the declension ending for the adjective (aka the `-em` part of the word `tallem`) happens to be the same as the declension ending for the noun (again the `-em` part of the word `tablem`). This is merely a lucky cooincidence, and is not at all a general feature of Polish declensions. 

We discover a counterexample immediately, finding that when the ball is *beside* the table, the adjective `tall` gets a new ending `-ego` which is not the same as the `-u` ending for the noun `tablu`. 


### A laundry list of difficulties related to Polish declensions
Here are some extra facts regarding declensions in Polish:

* Some words in some of the 7 declensions are recognizeably phonetically similar to each other, while others are not. 

* Adjectives, nouns, pronouns, numbers, and some other words have the 7 declension forms, though adverbs, some possessives, and some other words don't.

* Polish has >2 genders, but some genders only exist in a small number of declensions. So in general, each declension has N genders, where N is an integer which depend on declension. For example, declension A might have 3 genders, while declension B might have only 2 genders, such that you cannot remember "The Polish word for `horse` is always a masculine noun," because in some declension forms it is simply masculine, while in others it might be a neutral noun or some other harder-to-concisely-explain gender. There is a further wrinkle in that some of the genders depend approximately on whether the noun represents a living aka animate thing, or a non-living aka inanimate thing, and the usual suite of exceptions and special cases etc.

* Unlike English, there are multiple pluralities. In Polish, the word for "car" changes depending on *how many cars there are*. This often (justly) strikes students as utter madness. Here's an example:

*English:* 

```There is one car.```

*English again, but plural*: 

```There are two cars.```

*English again, even more plural*: 

```There are five cars.```

Note that the word "car" only comes in two flavors, 1) "car" and 2) "cars," and that the rule for deciding which form to use is pretty simple: 0 cars, 1 car, 2+ cars. Polish differs insofar as it has more flavors of each word, depending on plurality, and the rules for picking which one to use are not so simple as in English. Here's a quick example:

*Using Polish declension form, glued to the end of English:* 

```There is one car.```

*Using Polish declension form, glued to the end of English, but plural:* 

```There are two cary.```

*Using Polish declension form, glued to the end of English, but even more plural:*

```There are five car√≥w.```


So above, we've mentioned that most words come in 7 declension forms, and approximately 2 or 3 genders, and approximately 2 or 3 pluralities. The practical consequence of this is a combinatorial explosion in word forms. If we try to estimate the complexity, we find (7 declension forms * ~3 genders * ~2 pluralities) ~= 42 versions of each word, which you'll have to know about and choose correctly and understand in real time. On the bright side, some of these ~42 are duplicates of each other, perhaps due to a shortage of easily-pronouncable suffixes. And others of them follow approximate patterns, where even if you don't have the correct word form memorized, you can usually reason your way through to a plausible-sounding guess of the proper word form, given a little time to think. However, you'll still have to keep track of all these rules/patterns, which is widely regarded as one of the harder parts of learning Polish. 

Complicating the situation somewhat, normal Polish people mostly cannot for the life of them explain this declension-form situation to you; they do it correctly without thinking. If you ask Polish people "why do I need to apply declension-form-suffix X to word Y in situation Z??", Polish people will think for a moment, then nod and sagely say something like "it's kogo/czego", and proceed to look satisfied with themselves as if this pronouncement has dispositively concluded the matter. They're right, of course, it is in fact "kogo/czego," and they know how to apply that in practice, but them telling you those two words is *far* from a complete explanation of what's happening under the hood. And you, a confused foreigner, remain totally baffled. So speaking Polish and teaching Polish are two separate skills, more so than in most disciplines. Of course teaching basketball or ballet is not the same as being a good basketball player or a good ballerina, but the teaching-doing gap is extra wide for Polish.


### Pronunciation and spelling

Polish contains a lot of sounds like English "shh" or "ch", and has *many* ways of writing subtle variations of these sounds (common examples of these are sz, cz, rz, ≈∫, ≈º, si, dz, d≈∫, d≈º, dzi but probably there are more too). Most of spelling in Polish is easy/mostly-phonetic, but it's usually hard to figure out which of the many "ch/sh" characters+digraphs you need. Most of those subtle variations are approximately phonetically indistinguishable to your non-native ear, but native speakers can and readily do distinguish between them. When you're speaking, most Polish speakers are super-shockingly-accepting of your terrible accent and gibberish pronunciation; the language tolerates a lot of abuse while remaining intelligible. However, the exception to this wide latitude is in the "sh/ch" sounds; mistaking one "sh/ch" sound for another subtly different one seems insignificant to you, because they're the same sound in English, but native speakers will often be genuinely unable to guess what words you're trying to say. If you do extreme versions of this class of mistake, such as conflating "shh" with "sss", hilarity ensues.

Written Polish also looks scary. People joke that "Polish is a holy jihad fought against vowels, which are regarded in Polish as irredeemably evil" and this is perhaps not far from the truth. So you'll find words like the classic textbook examples below (all of which are eminently pronounceable according to Polish pronunciation rules, but you'll have trouble if you try to apply English pronunciation, and they tend to intimidate new students.)

* D≈ºd≈ºysty
* Polszczyzny
* Ksiƒô≈ºniczka
* ≈πd≈∫b≈Ço
* Szczecin
* ≈Å√≥d≈∫
* Pszczo≈Ça
* ChrzƒÖszcz
* Ochrzczony

These words are slightly cherry-picked for difficulty, but they're within the ballpark of pronunciation difficulty you'll find in real life.



### Availability of good textbooks and pedagogy

In general, most (all?) introductory Polish textbooks are written in a pompous, frilly style, and take themselves very seriously, with great attention paid to correctness and an upright attitude. There is a school of thought which says that throwing students into the deep end like this is good for them; this is in my opinion wrong. Textbooks in a perfect world should be written in plain language and workmanlike prose, *in the students' native language*, so as to maximize the new-known connection, aka the connection between the (ocean of) genuinely *new* material and the *known* safe-harbor of English.

Infuriatingly, almost all textbooks of Polish for English speakers have all the directions/metacommentary/exercise-descriptions written in (complicated, advanced) Polish. Astoundingly, this is even true for A0 and A1 level books, which have content (in Polish, obviously) like "See Bob run. Run, Bob, run," but directions (also in Polish) like "Fill in the appropriately conjugated verb into the lower blanks in the following three exercises; take care to avoid conflating phonetically similar infinitives." 

This situation is absurd on its face; if you could understand those complicated directions, you wouldn't need a Polish book with such simple content. Surely the overwhelming majority of students have never read, understood, or gotten any value from this complicated Polish metacontent, though it probably makes the textbook authors feel smug and correct to write it.

Tragically, most of the words in the directions/metacontent are A) difficult and complicated and B) extremely rare and unlikely to ever be used outside of linguistics/language class. So not only have most Polish textbooks made the error of writing their directions in Polish, which is already unintelligible to 99% of students, they have compounded that error by using *difficult, tricky, useless* Polish. So in practice, big chunks of your textbook are very far down in an unhelpful region of the usefulness-difficulty curve.

Furthermore, most textbooks are often lavishly printed in color, but they tend to waste this color on stupid things like coloring chapter 5 red, chapter 6 blue etc, and uniformly (?) refuse to color-code their text in the most blindingly-obvious-pedagogically-useful way. Which, of course, is to color code the declension endings of each word throughout the entire book, e.g. a word which is declined into the accusative declension has its word root printed in ordinary black text, but the declined ending transformation printed in red. Similarly, the instrumental declension should always be green, the locative purple, etc. We've done that color coding here and it seems to help students a lot. 

Another problem with most (all?) prominent Polish pedagogical materials is the early introduction of uncommon words. In general, whatever textbooks/lessons/pedagogical materials you use to learn a new language should at the beginning spend approximately *all* their time using only and entirely the most 1000 common words in that target language, and no others. The definition of "1000 most common" should be constructed by parsing with a computer a large corpus of real-world conversational transcripts (and perhaps published prose) and thereby building a word frequency table, as is done in more-commonly-taught languages such as Spanish etc.

Having mastered those first 1000 commonest words, your materials should proceed to the next most common 1000 words, and so on until you finally arrive at rare words. Like many rarely-taught foreign languages, Polish pedagogical materials mostly do not follow this pattern at all. A0 and A1 textbooks typically introduce ridiculous situational and domain-specific vocabulary, exotic adverbs, words related to rare family members, and similar. This is (charitably) utterly ridiculous. The "metacontent in complicated Polish" problem described above is perhaps a special case of this general shortcoming.

Similarly, most (all?) Polish pedagogy emphasizes the learning of numbers in early lessons. Many Polish schools and textbooks persistently demand that a new student learn numbers up into the thousands, including (complicated) multiple declensions of numbers, often citing as motivation the need to discuss dates or prices. Needless to say, numbers greater than 9 are *absolutely not in the 1000 most common Polish words* whatsoever and should therefore be comprehensively ignored during the first ~months of study (at least, and arguably much longer). Furthermore, numbers happen to be particularly difficult in Polish, with a convoluted set of overlapping rules and special cases and even more than the usual subtle transformations of endings, such that enormous quantities of errors are utterly unavoidable. 

The practical consequence of this is that the student spends his time making the inevitable endless series of number-related errors, being constantly told that he's wrong, and gets demoralized. This is stupid, pointless pedagogy, with pernicious consequences for students' enthusiasm. Even in the best case, when a student learns the material perfectly, he is left with a nearly-useless skill that he can almost never exercise in real life (how often do you discuss numbers in your native language?). In the extremely rare real-life situation which absolutely requires numbers, all students can either A) type the relevant numbers on their phone, and show the screen or B) say the number digit by digit, like how people often talk about phone numbers.

You will need the accusative declension literally every single day which you ever speak Polish; numbers will be used perhaps once every week or two. Furthermore, the accusative declension is ~10x easier to learn than numbers up to the thousands, yet everyone wants to teach you the numbers first and foremost. Comedy, tragedy, or farce? You decide.


## Preposition mapping

There are many prepositions in Polish which map many-to-many with English prepositions, meaning that e.g. the Polish word for `from` is also the Polish word for `with`, depending on context, so you can't just cleanly translate from English without paying attention to context. Here's some examples, in English with just one single English word translated into Polish (note that here we've omitted the declension-ending-transformations described above, just for purposes of general simplicity.)

*Normal English:* 

```I am with Martin.```


*English, with one word translated to Polish:*


```I am z Martin.```

So here we see that the Polish word `z` means English `with`. But that same preposition can mean something totally different, if used in another context:

*Normal English:* 

`I am from America.`


*English, with one word translated to Polish:*

`I am z America.`

So the same Polish preposition aka word, (in this case it's a word with a length of just single letter, `z`) means two totally different things: both `with` and `from`.
This is not confusing for native speakers, because they infer the meaning of the preposition from the declension transformations applied to nouns and adjectives (which we have omitted here for simplicity). But as a new student, you can't yet perform that inference, so you end up constantly confused about prepositions.

Of course this is not merely a property of this one preposition `z` alone; instead, there are lots of "overloaded" prepositions like this, behaving in ways which you might not expect. TODO add some more examples of overloaded prepositions

This is one reason why it's hard to be idiomatic. You can be intelligible but not idiomatic. You also can't translate very many prepositions from English, for example, I have to go "on a beer" not "for a beer". This is a little like regional differences in English, like how people from New Jersey say that they're standing "on-line" and people from Denver say that they're standing "in line," but way more extreme.



## Very subtle phonetic distinctions between pairs of opposites
TODO:
In English, pairs of opposite verbs tend to (usually but not always) be phonetically distinct:
turn off/turn on
plug/unplug


Turn off/turn on
bring out/take away?
Slide out? Odsunac? Wsunac/wysunac
wejsc/wyjsc

similar-sounding opposite words, such as w≈Çoncyc and wy≈Çoncyc



This is related to the declension thing, insofar as prepositions are involved in context, which in turn are involved with declensions.

TODO context causes verb, verb causes preposition, preposition causes declension? 



## TODOS:

TODO: Absurd obsession with teaching numbers. Numbers in Polish are 1) really hard and 2) nearly totally useless and 3) tend to demoralize students because they're constantly being told that they're wrong. If you ever need a number you can type your phone and holding it up, or you can spell the number like a phone number. Perhaps you might need a few common dates, but you can memorize those in an hour and worry about general comprehension of numbers at the very end. 

TODO pluralizing nouns, overloading. It's not like english where if a word ends in S, it's probably plural, and if it doesn't, it's probably singular, barring some unusual Latinate exceptions such as "stadia" or "qualia" etc. In Polish, singular nouns can have a wide variety of endings, some of which are the same as plural nouns endings in other genders/declensions etc. So for example:

This situation leads to absurd results, like when you've been studying Polish for 2 years, and you're still spending hours learning to correctly pluralize nouns.


TODO: Agreement of Adjectives and verbs mostly does not take the same ending. In many romance languages, the transformations for e.g. feminizing an adjective and a noun are the same transformation. If you have "a delicious icecream" in Spanish, it is just "un delicioso helado." Note that both the adjective and the noun end in -o. Similarly, "a beautiful girl" in Spanish is "una hermosa chica." Again we see that all the words end in -a, regardless of whether they're an article, adjective, or noun. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it turns out to be a lot harder in practice for new Polish students to remember all the different adjective-noun ending transformation pairs for all combinations of gender and declension, plus the inevitable (and fairly frequent) special cases. Needless to say, some of the trans


TODO: Common words tend to be super-irregular. This is true in many languages, but more so in polish. Mezczyzna is gramatically female but semantically male etc. There are a bunch of these, think of some more examples.

TODO: there are like 50 forms of "to go". Which one should you use? It depends, are you going on foot or by car? Do you go regularly or it's a one-time deal? Did you successfully complete the act of going, or only partial? isc prysc jade etc.


TODO: Discuss the Imperfective/perfective thing, and the commonly-given extremely confusing explanation of the future tense. You only need 3 tenses really but they give you this shitty explanation involving "bede" which you rarely use in practice because it's like a future progressive, "I will be eating" which is not a thing that you say very often in practice.

TODO some possessives get declined/adjusted, while others don't. Jego vs jej vs swoje
TODO Does the gender of words change depending on declension? 

TODO mention teaching declensions glued to the end of English words as a possibility
